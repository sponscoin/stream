# Reverse Engineered Twitch.tv UI  (Responsive CSS Grid Experiment)

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/acupoftee/pen/LYVoqYb](https://codepen.io/acupoftee/pen/LYVoqYb).

Imagine a version of Twitch where you can stream AND upload gaming videos like letâ€™s plays. This would help games get even more exposure through more creators! I decided to code a proof of concept for an upload feature on Twitch. This website is known for building solid communities. I think publishers and creators who record lets plays instead of live streams could benefit from a feature like this on Twitch!
This was also a REALLY fun way to practice CSS grid.
